# Tachyon's Journey

"Tachyon's Journey" is an educational game about a character named Tachyon and his journey
across our universe and time.

His journey begins at the first planck time (a small fraction of a second) after the Big Bang, 
the beginning of our universe.
Tachyon, the main protagonist, is both curious and optimistic about the universe and travels
around at a speed faster than light to unravel its mysteries.
Tachyon is curious about who he is and in his journey he wants to make this universe a better
place.
Join Tachyon as he discovers fundamental physics such as gravity, fusion and state transition.

Meet interesting characters in his journey from Harry and Helen the Hydrogen,
Ingrid the Infrared and Garry the Gamma Particle.
Experience Tachyon's journey as he observes the births of moons, planets, suns, black holes to
galaxies, peaceful goldilock zones and the raging
wars of great forces (dark matter and dark energy).

# Chapter 1 - She said Yes
Tachyon wakes up finds himself amongst other Tachyon particles.
Tachyon: "Hi, fancy meeting you here"
Girl Tachyon: "Yeah, its cozy in here (blush)"
Tachyon: "Hey, its a bit less crowded in over there, want to join me for a spin?"
Girl Tachyon: "Yes ... (a bit reluctantly).  YES (quite affirmatively after some thought)"
But too late, for it then happened ... the Big Bang.  Particles started flying around ... including
the Girl Tachyon.
Mission: Keep the Girl Tachyon in range.
Game: Dodge asteroids as you try to keep up with the Girl Tachyon

# Chapter 2 - Lost and all alone
Time: 200 million years after the big bang
But to no avail.  Within a few planck time, she was gone.  They were all gone.
Tachyon was lost ... and all alone.
For the next 200 million years, he just stayed there moping ...
But one day ...
Harry the Hydrogen: "Coming through!"
Helen the Hydrogen: "Yipeeee!"
Tachyon: "??"
Tachyon: "Where are you going?"
Harry & Helen : "We're getting married!"
Tachyon: "Oh, congrats, I'm so happy for you"
Harry: "The ceremony is at the center of the star."
Tachyon: "Star, what's that?"
Harry: "Come along, we'll show you"
Mission: Help Harry and Helen "Fuse" in their matrinomy.  
Game: Control both Hydrogen particles to collide.  
Harry starts at the north, and helen from the west.
Tap both at roughly the same time so they collide in the center and fuse.
This process is called nuclear fusion ... the energy used to create a star

# Chapter 3 - The birth of the Incredible Hulk ... I mean Gamma Ray
Their wedding was awesome.
In fact millions and billions of Hydrogen particles were getting married
at the center of this star.  The fireworks are fantastic, but what was
more exciting was that Tachyon had now met a new friend: Garry the Gamma Ray.
Garry was just another kid, with the exception that he had A LOT of energy
and was born in this solar nuclear fusion process.
Garry wanted to explore the universe and the first thing he wanted to do
was to leave home, then center of the star.
Even with all the energy Garry had, this was not an easy task.
The journey is going to be perilous.
Mission: Help Garry escape home and into the vacuum of the Universe
Game: Help Garry jump from platform to platform (upwards).  There is
a small window in each platform and each platform moves.  Jump
though each windows to progress to the next platoform.

# Chapter 4 - The Escape into the Vacuum of the Universe
Time: 250 million years after the Big Bang
And so Garry finally did it.  He left home.  The journey from the inside
to out of the star had took him 50 million years.
And Garry was also a changed particle.  He had lost a lot of energy
in his escape from the star.  But most importantly, his hope to
travel and explore the universe was still alive.  Garry has now
become a particle of the Green light.  FYI, Gamma rays are the most
energetic packets of photons.  Green light is part of the visible spectrum.
Tachyon: "So now where, Garry?"
Garry: "I hear this there's a planet just a few minutes away from here, let's go!"
Garry: "Try to keep keep up if you can ;)"
And with that said, Garry took off at the speed of light.
Mission: Find Garry amongst all the other particles that have escaped the star.
Game: Identify Garry amongst all the other particles by his wavelength (Green)

# Chapter 5 - The Goldilocks Zone
Tachyon: "So which planet should we visit?"
Garry The Green Light: "I don't know yet, but I heard that organic life can exist in a Goldilocks zone and
I'd love to see organic life"
Tachyon: "Goldilocks and Organic Life ... can you explain that a bit more please?"
Garry The Green Light: "It is believed that organic life, life of matter with cells, can only exist in conditions 
that are not too hot or too cold.  I is further believed that the necessities of organic life flourish best with liquid water.  If a planet is too close to its star, water will evaporate into gas and if it is too far, it will turn
to ice, in which case, both extremes do not favor organic life"
Mission: Find a planet in the Goldilocks Zone
Game: Move left and right between the heat of the sun and the cold temperatures of the universe.

# Chapter 6 - The circle of life
And they found life.
It was rich in vegetation.  And Garry, being a photon, gave his life ... to bring life to the planet.
He gave up his energy to be photosynthesized to the plants on the planet.
Tachyon was sad to see Garry go, but happy to know that Garry had completed his desire.
Perhaps he journey didn't end, but rather it was just a transformation in a cicle of life.
As for Tachyon, he spent the next 3+ billion years in this solar system.
He witnessed the early beginnings of this planet to the migration of the organic life to this planet to others.
The cycle of this solar system didn't stop there ... Tachyon had witnessed the birth of planets and also
the demise of its creator - its star.  The star had gone supernova, but even that wasn't the end or the beginning.
The solar system was in a state of being pulled in to itself, but the sun has become a black hole.

# Last Chapter
Time: many centillion years later
And they slowed disappeared.
It seems like the war of the universe has come to an end and the
victor is Dark Energy.
Once again, Tachyon was lost and all alone.
And so he stayed where he was as the universe got colder and colder ...
As the temperature of the universe started to drop to absolute zero,
so did Tachyon's hope to be happy.
But then it happened ...
an unprecedented phenomenon in physics ... at least at the scale of the universe.
The universe was experiencing a phase transition.  Just like the effects of water as it changes from liquid to solid, the universe was entering its own
phase transition.  "Strings" started slowly appearing similar to how ice crystals are creating as liquid water changes to ice.
There was in fact a pattern to these "strings".  The seemed to be connected like a web and most strings seemed to be attached to a single point.
Tachyon decided to pull on the closest string that lead to the center of something ... Like a chord, it sent a note or a message ... down the string.
Almost instantaneously, the string relayed a message back.
Again, Tachyon pulled the string ... and again the string responded.
Was there someone at the end of the string trying to communicate back?
There was only one way to find out ... with all of Tachyon's speed, he followed the string.
Mission: Follow the string
Game: as you progress, we go through the summary of all his friends that he met in the past.  A history of his journey.

At the end of the string there was indeed someone waiting.
Girl Tachyon: "Hey you!!"
Tachyon: "Oh, wow, I never thought I'd see you again"
Girl Tachyon: "Me too.  Where have you been?"
Tachyon: "Umm ... pretty much all over the universe.  And yourself?"
Girl Tachyon: "Generally around here and the other side..."
Tachyon: "Here and the other side?  Where are we?"
Girl Tachyon: "We're at the center where the Big Bang started!"
She points to a black hole just a few meters away.
Tachyon: "Oh wow, is that the last black hole ... I thought they
were all gone millions of years ago"
Girl Tachyon: "No silly ... its a worm hole, not a black hole"
Tachyon: "And where does that lead to?"
Girl Tachyon: "To another universe of course.  Wanna join me?"
Tachyon: "Yes ... YES"
Girl Tachyon: "OK, follow me and try not to get lost this time"
She holds his hand and then leads him into the worm hole
In the faint distance, you hear them talk.
Tera: "BTW, my name is Tera, what is yours?"
Tachyon: "I don't have one ..."
Tera: "How about I call you Terry from now on?"
As the hold hands and disappear, a love shape appears over the wormhole
