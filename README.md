# Tachyon's Journey

"Tachyon's Journey" is an educational game about a character named Tachyon and his journey
across our universe and time.

His journey begins at the first planck time (a small fraction of a second) after the Big Bang, 
the beginning of our universe.
Tachyon, the main protagonist, is both curious and optimistic about the universe and travels
around at a speed faster than light to unravel its mysteries.
Tachyon is curious about who he is and in his journey he wants to make this universe a better
place.
Join Tachyon as he discovers fundamental physics such as gravity, fusion and state transition.

Meet interesting characters in his journey from Harry and Helen the Hydrogen,
Ingrid the Infrared and Garry the Gamma Particle.
Experience Tachyon's journey as he observes the births of moons, planets, suns, black holes to
galaxies, peaceful goldilock zones and the raging
wars of great forces (dark matter and dark energy).

# Chapter 1 - She said Yes
Tachyon wakes up finds himself amongst other Tachyon particles.
Tachyon: "Hi, fancy meeting you here"
Girl Tachyon: "Yeah, its cozy in here (blush)"
Tachyon: "Hey, its a bit less crowded in over there, want to join me for a spin?"
Girl Tachyon: "Yes ... (a bit reluctantly).  YES (quite affirmatively after some thought)"
But too late, for it then happened ... the Big Bang.  Particles started flying around ... including
the Girl Tachyon.
Mission: Keep the Girl Tachyon in range.
Game: Dodge asteroids as you try to keep up with the Girl Tachyon

# Chapter 2 - Lost and all alone
Time: 200 million years after the big bang
But to no avail.  Within a few planck time, she was gone.  They were all gone.
Tachyon was lost ... and all alone.
For the next 200 million years, he just stayed there moping ...
But one day ...
Harry the Hydrogen: "Coming through!"
Helen the Hydrogen: "Yipeeee!"
Tachyon: "??"
Tachyon: "Where are you going?"
Harry & Helen : "We're getting married!"
Tachyon: "Oh, congrats, I'm so happy for you"
Harry: "The ceremony is at the center of the star."
Tachyon: "Star, what's that?"
Harry: "Come along, we'll show you"
Mission: Help Harry and Helen "Fuse" in their matrinomy.  
Game: Control both Hydrogen particles to collide.  
Harry starts at the north, and helen from the west.
Tap both at roughly the same time so they collide in the center and fuse.
This process is called nuclear fusion ... the energy used to create a star

# Chapter 3 - The birth of the Incredible Hulk ... I mean Gamma Ray
Their wedding was awesome.
In fact millions and billions of Hydrogen particles were getting married
at the center of this star.  The fireworks are fantastic, but what was
more exciting was that Tachyon had now met a new friend: Garry the Gamma Ray.
Garry was just another kid, with the exception that he had A LOT of energy
and was born in this solar nuclear fusion process.
Garry wanted to explore the universe and the first thing he wanted to do
was to leave home, then center of the star.
Even with all the energy Garry had, this was not an easy task.
The journey is going to be perilous.
Mission: Help Garry escape home and into the vacuum of the Universe
Game: Help Garry jump from platform to platform (upwards).  There is
a small window in each platform and each platform moves.  Jump
though each windows to progress to the next platoform.

# Chapter 4 - The Escape into the Vacuum of the Universe
Time: 250 million years after the Big Bang
And so Garry finally did it.  He left home.  The journey from the inside
to out of the star had took him 50 million years.
