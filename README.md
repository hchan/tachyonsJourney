the beginning of our universe.

place.
Join Tachyon as he discovers fundamental physics such as gravity, fusion and state transition.

Meet interesting characters in his journey from Henry the Hydrogen,
Ingrid the Infrared and Garry the Gamma Particle.
Experience Tachyon's journey as he observes the births of moons, planets, suns, black holes to
galaxies, peaceful goldilock zones and the raging
wars of great forces (dark matter and dark energy).
